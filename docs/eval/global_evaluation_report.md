## 3️⃣ Design Language Consistency Analysis  

### 🔴 **Critical Technical Issues**

**Image Path Problems** (Systemic Issue):
- **7 slides** use incorrect `public/` prefixes instead of absolute paths
- Affects slides: 5, 11, 12, 13, 23, 26 - compromising visual consistency
- **High Priority Fix Required**: This violates Slidev technical requirements

**Layout Inconsistency Patterns**:
- Inconsistent use of `image-right` vs `image-left` without clear rationale  
- Mixed application of spacing standards across similar content types

### 🟡 **Design Standards Adherence**

**Color System Compliance** (Good):
- Proper use of v-mark highlighting in brand colors
- Consistent emphasis color application
- Background choices align with theme requirements

**Typography Standards** (Acceptable):
- Font hierarchy generally consistent
- Code blocks use appropriate monospace styling
- Some minor heading level inconsistencies

**Interactive Elements** (Mixed):
- Excellent v-clicks usage for progressive disclosure
- Well-implemented custom Vue components
- Some inconsistent animation timing

### 📈 **Design Consistency Score: 3.6/5**

## 4️⃣ Interaction & Animation Suitability Analysis

### 🟢 **Interactive Excellence**

**Outstanding Features**:
- **Slide 25**: Exceptional interactive logic puzzle with copy functionality
- **Slide 27**: Effective video switching controls for demonstration
- **Custom Components**: Well-integrated `<LLMDetails/>`, `<SelfAttentionDetails/>` components

**Animation Strategy Effectiveness**:
- Appropriate use of v-clicks to control cognitive load
- Progressive disclosure aligned with learning psychology
- Restrained approach prevents distraction from content

### 🟡 **Enhancement Opportunities**

**Underutilized Interactive Potential**:
- Monaco editors present but could be leveraged more extensively
- Limited use of interactive demonstrations for complex concepts
- Missing opportunities for self-assessment beyond final quiz

**Network Dependency Risks**:
- iframe content (Slides 24, 28) lacks offline fallbacks
- Video content needs loading failure handling
- Real-time benchmark data may become stale

### 📈 **Interaction Effectiveness Score: 4.1/5**
